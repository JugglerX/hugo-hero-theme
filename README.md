## Getting started

After installing the Hero theme successfully it requires a just a few more steps to get your site finally running.

### Adding example content

The fastest way to get started is to copy the example content. Copy the contents of the `exampleSite` folder to the root folder of your Hugo site. This theme comes with content for the following content types: `services` and `work`. The `about` us page is a single page with alternating fullwidth sections. It includes JSON data for `features` and `contact`. It also includes the `config.toml` file which has an example menu.

### Edit config

After you copy the `config.toml` into the root folder of your Hugo site you will need to update the `baseURL`

```
baseURL = "/"
```

## Running Hugo

After installing the theme, generate the Hugo site.

```
hugo
```

Hugo's built-in local server.

```
hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
